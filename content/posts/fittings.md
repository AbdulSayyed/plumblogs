## Materials used in Water pipes

- Plastics have revolutionised modern plumbing systems and come in different varieties not all of them are to be interchanged as they are designed for specific purposes. They are mainly divided into two types:
    + Those can be used for hot and cold water supply and central heating services ( plastic pressure pipes ) such as `Polyethylene PE` and `Polybutylene PB-1` and;
    + Those plastics used for `sanitation, drainage and rain water` system

### Plastic pipes for Sanitation, drainage and rainwater

- `PVC`: **Polyvinyl chloride** mostly used for draining and considered not safe for drinking. Can easily be identified by color and marks on the pipe. PVC comes in variety of thickness knowns as `schedules`. Connections are made by using a primer that softens the PVC and then applying PVC glue that melts the joints and pipe together. If used in drinking water they should be clearly labelled 

- `CPVC`: **Chlorinated Polyvinyl chloride** can be used for both cold and hot water due to tolerating heat up to 180 degree Fahrenheit. According to ( InterNACHI ) CPVC and PVC pips last for fifty to 80 years under perfect condition. They are also not used for drinking water in UK.

- `PVCu Or uPVC BS 4514`: **unplasticised Polyvinyl chloride** They are same as PVC they look same in inspection and feel the same. The only difference is in their chemical makeup and potential applications. ( u stands for unplasticised` ). uPVC is widely uses as a replacement for timber in products like doors and windows being more rigid and hardness.

    > In your home your windows frame are more likely to be made using uPVC while your drainage waste pipe that raised high up in atmosphere is made up by using PVC

- `PVCmu or MuPVC BS 5255`:**Modified unplasticised Polyvinyl chloride** Used for overflow pipe, more durable than PVCu perform better than other specially in higher temperature.

- `CuPVC`**Chlorinated unplasticised Polyvinyl chloride**: used for solvent weld cold water service pipe in the late 1970s. They have been replaced by new MDPE

- `ABS`: **Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene**  can easily be recognized by its black color and rigidity and used for drainage lines, waste pipes, they can also be used for mains cold water supplies.

- `Polypropylene`: Widely used in plumbing industry used for waste pipes, cistern, WC siphons and overlow piple work. It can not be solvent welded

### Plastic pipes for cold and hot water supply and central heating services

- `PEX or PE`:**Cross linked polyethylene** is a good for both hot and cold temperatures. The main lines coming into your home ( in UK ) with fresh cold water uses the material. It is considered more durable than copper. It is low cost cheaper then copper and comes in long rolls of tubing that easy to transport. Because of being flexible can be bent around the corner easily so few elbows and fittings are required speeding up the installations. They can be jointed using `push fittings and crimp rings`

    > Note: MDPE and HDPE are two kinds of PE that are used in water pipes. MDPE has superseded HDPE ( used in 1980s). They are hard wearing plastics for `water and gas pipe fittings`.

- MDPE stands for `medium density Polyethylene` manufactured in accordance with `BS EN 12056-2:2000` it is blue in color.

- `PB-1`: **Polybutylene**: Latest arrival in pressurised plumbing system. It has `high temperature and pressure resistance, low noise transmission, low thermal expansion and low thermal transmission`. Its internal bore is very smooth providing good flow rate and it doe snot suffer from corrosion or scaling. It conforms to `BS EN 1057` and used in wet central heating system and underfloor heating.

### Metal pipes used in cold and hot water supply and central heating

- `Copper tube BS En 1057`: Commonly used in cold and hot water distribution also used in `HVAC` system. If used under ground a protective sleeve should be used. They can last for fifty years as it ages it thins out leading to pinhole leaks. R220 and R250 are two commonly used copper pipes in cold and hot water pipes. Copper tubes can be used for ` cold and hot water, central heating services, gas installation ( oxygen, methane and other gases ), oil system and sanitation systems`.

- `Chromium coated copper tube`: they are used where `aesthetics` consideration to be made. And `plastic coated` copper known as `kutelex` is available where protection from the elements is essential.

- `Galvanized Steel or Iron`: Galvanized pipe is steel pipe that has been treated with zin coating. This keeps the water away from corroding the pipe. They were used in pre 60's building or houses, they have shortest span of life up to 40 years.

### The benefits of using `Polybutylene pipes`

![pb.png](/images/plumbing/bending/pb.png)

It does not affect the taste or colour of the water.
- There is minimal internal resistance, thereby increasing flow rates.
- It is very flexible, even at very low temperatures.
- It is highly resistant to stress.
- It is non-corrosive.
- It involves safe installation processes; no flame is needed or chemicals such as
flux required during installation, and it therefore presents no risk to installers.
- It has high resistance to frost damage.
- It is not affected by water hardness or softness.
- It is not affected by chemical central heating inhibitors or anti-freezes.
- It is unaffected by micro-biological growth.
- It has high impact strength.
- It is suitable for heating and cooling applications.
- There are a multitude of coil lengths for economical installation with minimal
waste.
- It has a low environmental impact in terms of soil, water and air pollution.

### Method of joining the metal and plastic pipes

There are four main methods of jointing:

1. Compression : Used in copper and plastics, compression fittings which are made from plastic are known as `Philmac` fittings and used in connecting `MDPE to MDPE` and to most form of pressure pipe, including copper and lead.
2. Soldered : Only used in copper
3. Push : used in plastics
4. Press : Used in copper
5. Fusion Welded: Large underground water mains use fusion welded fittings. Fittings and the pipe are welded together by heat created by electricity.

---

### Different types of fittings used in jointing

- Compression fittings / joints

![01-joints.png](/images/plumbing/bending/01-joints.png)

- Soldered Capillary joints

![02-capillary.png](/images/plumbing/bending/02-capillary.png)

- Push fit joints

![03-push-fittings.png](/images/plumbing/bending/03-push-fittings.png)

- Press fit joints

![06-press-fittings.png](/images/plumbing/bending/06-press-fittings.png)


---
### Compression joints

- compression joints are of two Types:
1. `Manipulative type Or Type B` : This type - B fittings is mostly used for gas lines. It requires `flaring` or `belling` the tubing. To remove this type of fitting, a specialised tool is used to pull or siging the nut and olive away fro the pip or tube.
    
![05-type-b.png](/images/plumbing/bending/05-type-b.png)

2. `Non Manipulative or Type A` : They are commonly used for water fittings and do not require and `flaring or belling` so they are known as non-manipulative fittings.
    
- **non-manipulative Type A compression fittings**: It consist of three parts:
    + `A Compression nut`
    + `A metal olive usually made of copper too` also known as `copper O ring`
    + `A fitting body`

![04-type-a.png](/images/plumbing/bending/04-type-a.png)    

- Compression fittings require a `compressive force` to the pipe and pipe fittings to form a tight seal.
- The fitting is compressed against the pipe with a force that removes any space between the joints.


### Soldered Capillary Joints

- Domestic plumbing used `soft soldered joints`.
- They are made up of two type of fittings:
    + `integral solder ring`: It has a bend of lead-free solder housed inside a raised ring on the fitting socket. So extra solder is not needed
    + `end feed`: It does not have solder in the fittings and does not contain a bend.

![05-solder-capilary.png](/images/plumbing/bending/05-solder-capilary.png)

- Solders that  `contain  lead are not allowed` on pipework used for either hot or cold water supplies


### Push-fit / slip fits joints

1. Push fit joint can be made from plastic or metal.
2. A `stainless steel grab wedge ring` is used to lock the pipe in place, and a `neoprene O ring` makes it watertight joint.
3. They are quite bulky fittings and do not look attractive where they are exposed.
4. They can be disconnected and reused

- Common type push fittings:

![08-common-push-fittings.png](/images/plumbing/bending/08-common-push-fittings.png)

- They are available in different sizes and can be recognized with respective color.
    + Green : 10mm
    + Bloue: 15mm
    + Maroon/Brown : 22mm
    + Oragne: 28mm

- [Hep2O Push-fit Plumbing guide](/files/plumbing/hep2o-guide.pdf)

---

- **How do push fittings works**

- Pipe is simply pushed into fittings, that has a `metal grab ring` which allow the insertion in only one direction.
- The pipe having passed through the `grab ring` also passes  an `o-ring` and meets the `metal end ring` and stops
- Once it is properly pushed in the grab ring applies the resistance to let the pipe out if any pressure is applied due to flowing of water in either direction.

> Note if the pipe is not fully inserted it will leak either use the marks printed on the pipe as a guide or make sure they are pushed at least `one inch` into the fittings.

- Even if it is pushed back simply it does not come out due to grab ring acting in opposite direction

![09-hep2-crossection.png](/images/plumbing/bending/09-hep2-crossection.png)

- To take the pipe out, you either need to use `HepKey plus` separately or if a `collect` is provided with fittings press it to loosen the pipe.
- By pushing the hepkey-plus using only one hand the grab ring is pushed inside allowing space for the pipe to come out easily.

![10-using-hepkey.png](/images/plumbing/bending/10-using-hepkey.png)

- `Use of inserts` in pipe fittings, they are pushed into the pipes before joining the pipes into the fittings. They provide extra layer of protection against any damage. Different companies that makes pb-1 pipes and provide their own inserts some of them are :
- [Hep2O](https://www.hep2o.com.au/),
- [JG Speedfit](https://www.johnguest.com/gb/en/products/jg-speedfit/fittings),
- [Polyplumb](https://www.polypipe.com/polyplumb-0)
- [Plusson Fittings](https://www.plasson.co.uk/)

- Inserts are also known as `SmartSleeve` or `pipe support sleeve` and servers many purposes:
    + it ensures the pipe retains its circular cross-section
    + it maintains the rigidify of the pipe within the fittings
    + the end also let you feel that it is fully inserted and `barbs` on the sleeve properly locks it in the pipe.

- Hep2O fittings do not come with fitted `collect` which is provided with `Speedfit` instead a key is used to take the pipe out from the fittings.

![11-inserts-keys.png](/images/plumbing/bending/11-inserts-key.png)

- When using Speed-fit products before inserting the pipe the screwcap is turned half way in one direction and then in another direction after inserted pipe.

---

- **Jointing PB-1 or Polybutylene pipe**

- They can be jointed in two ways, one is to use `push-fits` and second is to use `type A non non-manipulative` compression fittings.
- When using push fits, a pipe is cut using `plastic pipe cutter` which ensures that a clean cut  to the pipe. Do not use hacksaw or any other saw.
- Push `the pipe insert into the pipe`, lubricate the end of the pipe and if marks are present use `>` marks as a guide to fully push the pipe into the joints until the fitting stop is felt.

> When to use pipe inserts ?

- Pipe inserts are to used in every fittings but If a compression fittings are to be used a pipe is insert is must without the insert the joint will leak. The reason being the working of the compression fittings, when it is tightened it uses a metal o-rign to form a seal. A pipe too soft to support the olive being crushed onto it. The pipe inserts supports the pipe wall.

![12-push-copper.png](/images/plumbing/bending/12-push-copper.png)

- **Connection to Imperial pipe fittings**

- Connection also comes in `imperial sizes` that is measured in inches `"`, if you find an existing fittings in imperials they can also be connected to fittings that comes in metrics mesuared in `mm`. There is no difference is material or strength but only in size assigned by the manufacturer due to being common in the market.

- Speedfit provides couplers that can connects imperial to imperial sizes but also imperials to metric sizes for instance a 1/2 inch to 15mm or 1/2 inch to 1 inch BSP and BSPT ( BSP is British standard pipe thread while BSPT refers to British Standard Pipe tapered thread)

### Types of machine bend

- It is better to bend the pipes as it is cheaper, allows faster flow and does not require soldering.
- The parts of the pipe bending machine:
    + Former: It is called former because it forms the shape of the pipe.
    + Guide: It helps form the shape, it sits on top of the pipe.
    + Hook/stopper: It stops the pipe flickering or moving
    + Rollers/wheels: Two rollers fitted on the hands, if they are not working properly that is if loose, broken then you get a ripple under the bend.

![01-tube-bender.png](/images/plumbing/bending/01-tube-bender.png)

- Different types of bends can be done using the pipe bender.

1. `90 or square`: More than 3 inches gets involved in 90 degree bend.
2. `Offset`:
3. `Passover`:

- When a pipe is bended it grow by its diameter size, 15mm will grow `7.5 mm` from either side.
- It is stretched in both direction, so a 22mm pipe will gorw 11mm in each direction.

### How to bend a pipe

- First use a marker to mark the measure end of the pipe. A `Measure end` is the end which go past the hook and we work away from it.

![02-tube-bender.png](/images/plumbing/bending/02-tube-bender.png)

### How to make a 90 degree bend

1. Draw a mark on measured end.
2. Draw a mark on the desired length e.g., 250mm from the marked end. This is the point where 90 degree bend occurs. Note it is the centre of the pipe.

![03-tube-bender.png](/images/plumbing/bending/03-tube-bender.png)

3. Insert the pipe into bending machine up to the mark made above so that it draws 90 degree to another pipe. Use the hook to hold it and slide a guide between the pipe and the roller.

![04-tube-bender.png](/images/plumbing/bending/04-tube-bender.png)

4. Then you start bending the pipe and measure the exact 90 degree using any tool.

![05-tube-bender.png](/images/plumbing/bending/05-tube-bender.png)

5. The same procedure can be repeated for this 90 degree parallel off set if required.

> If a total length required from point A to B horizontally and from B to C vertically is say 100 mm in laying out a 15 mm pipe what total length of the pipe should you use in 90 degree bending


---

### How to make an offset of desired distance

-  We need to turn the pipe to certain degrees ( 30, 45 , 60, 75 ) to avoid the hindrance when laying the pipes. It is known as off set that is we are changing our path to certain degree because of any hindrance present on the way permanently.

- The difference between these angles and 90 degree is only of angle. So by using off set ruler a bigger compass we can turn the pipe to a desired degree.
- It is also possible that we can engrave permanent mark on the former to indicate these degrees.
- When these offsets are made they take some length of the pipe in making turns or degree.
- This `length of the turn gives obstacle` to a immediate next parallel turn that is from how far away the next parallel turn can be made. This length is marked with white lines.

![06-tube-bender.png](/images/plumbing/bending/06-tube-bender.png)

- Let say we have a hindrance on the way of our pipe and we need to bend our pipe 60mm away as shown in the diagram.
- To achieve this off set of 60mm which angle should be suitable. From the above figure we can see that 60  degree can not provide the 60 mm offset.
- So the smaller the off set distance is the smaller the degree of bend would be !
- From above diagram we can say that it may be that 45 degree or less would be required to achieve 60mm turn. 

    > Note: From the above we can keep this rule in our mind that if we have an offset of `60mm or less`, we can blindly use `45 degree or less angle`.

![07-tube-bender.png](/images/plumbing/bending/07-tube-bender.png)

> Note: From the above we can keep this rule in our mind that if we have an offset of `60mm or less`, we can blindly use `45 degree or less angle`.

- With 30 degree angle we can extend the length of the pipe bend and continue to do our parallel turn.

- **Making an offset**:
- To do so we need to first again make two marks first one is our `measure end` and the second mark is the point where the bend starts. Les say it is 150 mm, and we make a mark there ( mark a plus sign to get the correct centre ) and place this pipe in the tube bender making sure that the this mark is placed where `the former and the guide touches each other` as shown in the figure below.

![14-offset.png](/images/plumbing/bending/14-offset.png)

- This is the first bend that is made on either to a measured angle or as from our above rule to 45 or less degree if an offset distance is of 60 mm or less.
- Another method to find the correct angle is called `600 mm folding rule`. That is to deduct the off set distance from the 600 mm and open the required angle using bending ruler.

![16-offset-rule.png](/images/plumbing/bending/16-offset-rule.png)


- Once it is done the next parallel turn is to be made. In order to do so we need to place the pipe flipping  180 degree to make the next mark on the pipe to start a turn.

![15-offset-second-mark.png](/images/plumbing/bending/15-offset-second-mark.png) 

- Once this mark is made using the bending machine next turn is made to the same angle. 

![17-offset-second-turn.png](/images/plumbing/bending/17-offset-second-turn.png)

-

### Pass over bend Or Cross over

- As the name suggest we only need to pass over any hindrance present  and we do so not by changing our path but only to make a bent that passes the hindrance over and continue the same route.
- The measurement for a passover bend are taken in the same way as for an ordinary offset.
- The angle of the first pull will be governed by the size of the obstacle it has to pass over.
- The procedure is as follows:
    1. Make a centre mark on the pipe first  by measuring the distance from a fixed point to the centre of the obstacle.
    2. Make a second mark by adding 1/4 th dia of the obstruction as shown below

![18-pass-over.png](/images/plumbing/bending/18-pass-over.png)

- Then using the second mark slide the pipe into the former until it touches the guide same as offset angle.

![20-passover.png](/images/plumbing/bending/20-passover.png)

- Then using the folding ruler turn the pipe to the desired angle. To find the correct angle you need to multiply the diameter by 3. Or using a thumb rule this bend is more than a 45 but less than a 90 degree.
- Once it is done place the bend on the obstacle and make both bending marks on either side to turn the pipes.

![21-passover.png](/images/plumbing/bending/21-passover.png)

- Draw / Mark a straight line on copper pipe for the next bend, and draw another mark around the copper pipe passing through the centre of the first mark. You can also draw horizontal line on the the other side to made `+` mark. This comes handy if the pipe is to be bended so both sides are visible when inserted in the pipe bend.

![22-passover.png](/images/plumbing/bending/22-passover.png)

## Pipe Threads

- Fittings are used to connect two or more pipes in two ways either `by threads` or by `slip fit/push fit`. While metal pipes are threaded, the plastic pipe can be threaded or slip fit.

### Types of thread

- **Right-handed or Left-handed Threads**: Nearly all threads are oriented so that a bolt or nut or any fitting can be tightened. By turning it in a clockwise direction, the item turned moves away from the viewer. And it is loosened by turning anticlockwise when the item moves towards the viewer . This is known as a right-handed thread. Left-handed threads are oriented in the opposite direction. There are also self-tapping screw threads where no nut or bolt is required.
- **Male Threads**:In male threads, the threads of the pipe are on the outside. Here, tapered pipe threads like NPT, BSPT etc. are used sealing without gaskets.
- **Female Threads**:In female threads, the threads are on the inside. Here too, like male threads, tapered pipe threads are used for sealing.
- **Male Straight Thread**:Pipe threads like UNC, UNF, ASME, etc form Male Straight Thread.
- **Female Straight Thread**: Straight pipe threads like UNC, UNF, ASME, etc.
- **Plain End**: This is used to connect or insert into the bell end of the connecting pipe.
- **Bell / Socket / Flare**: This represents the end length of increased diameter into which a pipe end can be fitted.
- **Flange**: Flanges are used to connect fitting, via bolting or welding. There are basically two types of flanges, `circular and square`.
- **Compression Fitting**: This represents compression nut and ferrule ( olive or metal ring ) to connect to a mating pipe.
- **Pipe Clamp End**: It is so designed so as to attached to run on pipe or other fitting.
- **Barb / Rib**:This represents fitting ends to connect only non-rigid pipe or hose. It is sometimes used with a clamped end.
- **Groove**:This refers to the installation of a coupling feature like an o-ring or elastomeric seal.
