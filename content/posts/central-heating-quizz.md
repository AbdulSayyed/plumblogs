<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-3 When hot water cylinder is removed from a property and a combi boiler is used what electrical measures should be taken into account ?

- A fused spar used with system boiler when immersion heater hot water cylinder was in use, need `13 amp` with `16amp mcb`. These both should be replaced with `3 amp and 6 amp` simultaneously

---
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-4 What size of cable is used from `consumer unit to fused spar` when fitting for the boiler ?

- It is `1.5 mm or 2.5 mm` cable is used

---
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-5 Why a motorised valve has four wires instead of five wires ?
 
 - Honeywell motorised valves comes with five wires the extra wire is for `earth`. It is because valve body is made up of a steel ( that is conductor ).
 - Some companies make motorised valve with plastic body and does not need earth wire thus provide only four wires.

 > Q-6  What is the resting position of three port motorised valve ?

 - Hot water open.

---

<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-7 If a central heating contains 150l of water, how much water an F&E need to accomodate when it is heated ? 

- 4% of 150l =  ( 150 * 4 ) / 100 = 600 /100 = 6l  

---

<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-8 What device reduces possible noise and boiler lock out.

- Automatic by pass allows the `minimum water flow` required by the boiler between flow and return pipe where ABV is used to release the pressure that  may have been created due to no other routes present for the water flow. 
- With increase pressure noise is created in the system. If no such route is provided or pressure is not released the boiler will shut down indicating error.

---

> Q-9 A combination boiler uses a diverter or hot water priority motorised valve. What plan it is known by  ?

---
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-10  A customer has two room upstiars and two down downstairs, he only has one TRV where should it be installed ? 

- The best position is to install it in upstairs room where TRS in not present. As the heat rises.

> Q-11 Can we install a TRV on Tower rails in bathroom ?

- No, TRVs are not installed on tower rails.

---
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-12 What is a boiler cycling ? 

- It fires up and cools down and carry on doing it as a result a lot of stress is applied on the boiler.
- It used to happen in old systems where boiler was only controlled by the temperature of water present in primary circuits.
- But it also happens in modern systems because of being controlled by a RTS which is located in the coldest part of the hall way. The hall way takes a long time to heat up and by that time the boiler is working with full efficiency and possibly overheating the rooms
- When it reaches the desired temperature it sends the signal to shut the boiler but as soon as it gets cold starts the boiler again.
- This unnecessary cycling is the indicator that boiler is working inefficiently and should be avoided

1. Minibore term are used for grade `R250` which comes in sizes of `15, 22 and 28 mm` copper pipes. They are also known as `half hard straight length of copper`. Note: They are also known as `small bore`. In majority of fully pumped system, small bore pipe is used of either `15mm and 22mm`.

2. Microbore term is used for grade `R220` which comes in sizes of `6-8-10 and 12 mm` and used with manifolds in some central heating systems where flexibility is required, every radiator has its own loop.

---
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-14 Difference between permanent and temporary decommissioning ?

- Temporary decommissioning is needed when a system is worked on for a short period of time. For example replacing a part, draining the system etc.
- Permanent decommissioning is needed when system is being taken out of service, dismantled or stripped out.

---
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-42 In waste and soil pipes a `self-cleansing velocity` is created by ensuring the pipework

- right fall

---

> Q-43 What is temperature kept for central-heating and hot water system in modernized or fully pumped systems using Y-Plan ?

- The temperature for `central-heating is 85 C and for hot water it is 60 C`

---

> Q-44 What is the programming sequence for Y-plan when demand comes for CH / Central-heating ? 

1. From `programmer --> Room Stat --> mid-positioned valve --> Pump --> Boiler`

- In practical since all wiring is connected to a junction box, the call always uses the junction box to give messages to each part. So the sequence would be as follows
- From `Prog --> JB --> Room Stat --> Back to JB from JB --> mid-positioned valve --> Back to JB and so on`
---

> Q-45 What is the programming sequence for Y-plan when demand comes for hot water / HW ? 

- From `programmer --> cylinder stat --> pump --> boiler`.

---

> Q-46 What amps are used for the boiler and in consumer unit ? 

- Boiler uses a `3 amp cartridge` while a consumer unit uses a `6 amp MCB`

---

> Q-47 What is the position of motorised valves in S and Y plans ? 

- They are connected near to the cylinder !

---

> Q-48-A Where are TRVs fitted in gravity fed system ? 

- They are not fitted in gravity fed system. They are only fitted in pumped central-heating system along with RTS. The room in which RTS is fitted no TRVs to be fitted on the radiator so that correct temperature reading can be achieve. TRVs are always fitted on the return pipe but there is disagreement so it is best to follow the manufacturer advice.
-  Some TRVs comes with indication of arrows to allow TRVs to be fitted  from either side that is horizontal and vertical. The arrow ( ==> ) signs indicates the flow direction.
-  Modern TRVs are called `bi-directional` so can be fitted on either on flow or return.

> Q-48-B Why are they installed on Sealed system and what measures should be taken ?

- TRVs allows individual rooms to be controlled separately, if all TRVs are satisfied and there is no need for hot water as it happens during the night. The system receives the signals and boiler has to shut down. Since the boiler temperature is very hot, it has to run for some time to cool down the temperature. And for water to circulate it must have by pass fitted with ABV. The loop allows water to circulate in the provided circuit and ABV allows the pressure build up by the circulator to be released.
- The ABV also allows to ensure that a satisfactory minimum flow rate is maintained through the boiler.
- It is the requirement of some boilers that bypass should be fitted with ABV for `pump over-run`


---

> Q-49 If all radiators are switched off being satisfied in pumped heating system. What mechanism is provided to ensure minimum water flow rate occurs in boiler if needs be?

- When using zone valves, if both hot water and heating circuits are satisfied, a by pass is installed between flow and return pipe after the circulator using  ABV. Since TRVs and Zone valve closes the circuit. The pressure goes over the pre set limit. `Using the ABV reduces the system noise and increase pump life by preventing it working against a dead head`.

- A `dead head` situation is caused when a pump has to operate without a flow of water through it or due to blockage in the line. If it happens it burns the bushes or seat in the pump.

---
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-50 What is a boiler pressure relief valve ? 

- It is fitted inside the boiler to prevent boiler being heated to a dangerous temperature. It is s T/PRV ( Temperature or pressure realise valve ) and allows the water to escape through the condensing pipe. Some boiler also automatically shuts down if the pressure goes very high. It is also known as safety relieve valve.

---
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-51 What is role of boiler stats ? 

- The boiler stats only dictates the temperature of the water in the boiler and has nothing to do with room TRS. The water that flows in heating flow pipe is the same that is coming from the boiler. So if the boiler temperature is kept low e.g., (50 C). The water running in pipes and radiators can not be more than this temperature. It is usually set to 85 C.
- It is to set the minimum and maximum temperature of your boiler heat exchanger.

    > Note: Combination boiler have two stats `one for hot water and one for central-heating`

> Q-52 What is role of cylinder stat ? 

- It controls the temperature of hot water in the cylinder.

---
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-53 What are central-heating pumps ? 

- Central heating pump or Heating Circulator are fitted either inside the boiler or near the airing cupboard. They make sure that the water is pumped into the radiators and comes back to the boiler.
- There are different types of heating pumps, `2-speed, 3-speed or modern high efficiency pump` that will automatically adjust the speed of the pump according to demand.
- They are called electronic pumps.
- They all need electricity to work. From one end water enters and from the other end its exit with pressure. They have two `user-controls` on the pump that are seldom used.
- The first is to `adjust pump pressure and second is pump bleed screw`. These allows to adjust the pressure and bleed the pump if air enters the pump.
- When it runs it vibrates a little.

---
<!-- .slide: data-transition="slide" data-background="snowhite" data-background-transition="zoom" -->

> Q-54 Which boiler only controls the heating only ? 

- A combi boiler controls the heating only  as the hot water is produced on demand. As it is produced on demand instantly when you turn on the tap there is no need for the cylinder to store the hot water thereby not control over hot water.

---

> Q-55 In which system boiler position can be higher than the cylinder ? 

- Fully pumped systems


---

> Q-56 What is `Pumped central-heating` ? 

- Older type system that have provision for heating by means of a pump but no provision for hot water system


--- 

> Q-57 If a property is over 150 square meter which plan is best suited ?

- `S-Plan plus` system incorporates the needs of an external zone when a property is more than 150 square meter.

---

> Q-58 Locking out 

- This is a protection system within a boiler. A thermostat shuts the boiler if it detects the flow is above 85 Degree centigrade therefore stops it from overheating.

---

> Q-59 In sealed system what else is required to accommodate water expansion other than expansion vessel ? 

- A PRV will need to be installed. This allows the system to discharge pressure to a safe location if required.

---

> Q-60 Which two pipes should not contain any valve in vented central-heating system ? 

1. It is the cold feed pipe coming from the F&E cistern to the boiler. it is to make sure that in case of overheating there is a constant supply of cooler water to the system to prevent the dangerous condition of boiling.
2. A vent pipe should also not contain any valve at all ( service valve or isolation valve ), and it must rise `450mm` above the water level to ensure that the system must remain at atmospheric pressure limiting the temperature to 100 degree C.

---

> Q- 61 What is open safety vent ? 

- In fully pumped system, if a pressure surge happens, it is accommodated by the vent pipe rising to a minimum height of 450 mm above the water level in the F&E cistern

![surge-effect.png](/images/plumbing/central-heating/surge-effect.png)

---

> Q- 62 Where should an air separator be located ? 

- For a heating system, the ideal location is at the outlet of the heat source.

![manual-air-separator.png](/images/plumbing/central-heating/manual-air-separator.png)

- In Hydronic system the best place is where the `water temperature is high and pressure is low.

![auto-air-separator.png](/images/plumbing/central-heating/auto-air-separator.png)

> Q-94 What is the difference between two devices ?

![trv-tmrv.png](/images/plumbing/central-heating/trv-tmrv.png)

- Right is a TRV valve with remote sensor often used when it is hidden due to curtains and fitted on radiators.
-  While left is a `TMCCV` thermo mechanical cylinder control valve used in  gravity systems to control the temperature of the hot water. It works like TRVs and control the flow of cylinder water based on its temperature.
-  They are recommended to be used where no motorised zone valves are installed that controlled the flow of hot water regulated by CST. The capillary should be positioned about `1/4 - 1/3` and valve is fitted either on return or flow.

> Q-95 A combi boiler with a continuous wet condensing pipe is the sign of ?

- Boiler over heating. When it happens boiler needs to release the pressure that comes out through the condensate valve.
- A zip bag or balloon be fitted to see if it is continuously coming.

---

> Q-96 Why is it a best practice to install a pump on flow pipe ? 

- In modern system when the water returns to the boiler a `magnet filter` is used just before the boiler on the return valve so it collects all the debris.
- Then water flows from the boiler to the system where pump is installed a the entural position on the flow pipe.
- This arrangement increases the life of pump and any wear and tear caused by sludge and other sidiments collecting in the pump.
- The positioning of the pump is important on the vented system and not very critical in sealed system. In most combi boilers

---

> Q-97 How would you design a sealed system allowing different circuits for HW and CH ?

- Using a conventional boiler a sealed cylinder is required.
- Being a pressurised system following safety devices must be fitted:
    1. An expansion vessel with a safety PRV and a pressure guage.
    2. A temporary or permanent filling loop to pressurise the system.
- All of the above devices are installed on return pipe
- Using System boilers that contain all necessary safety controls
- Using combination boilers

---

> Q-98 What is main purpose of fully pumped systems ?

- They offer a better choice of both `system design and boiler choice`.
- They give more options when it comes to install a boiler ( no more need to install a boiler below the cylinder ) as the water is pumped in both circuits.
- They heat up the system quickly than gravity system.
- They can use both S, W and Y Plan using natural gas, LPG and oil appliances.

---

> Q-99 What is energy cut out known as `high temperature limiting thermostat` ?

- They are installed in boiler to guard against overheating.
- They indicate the signal to boiler mother board of system being overheated.
- The boiler then comes in `pump overrun mode` running the pump for short period of time even after the boiler shuts down.
- This ensures that the water in heat exchanger cools down so that the boiler lock out does not occur.
- If this is not done the energy cut out can trigger boiler lock-out.

---

> Q-100 What is dew point ?

- It is the temperature at which the moisture within a gas is released to from water droplets.
- Gas holding the water when comes to this temperature due to cooling can no longer hold the water.

---

> Q-101 If a boiler used is above 45KW, what category water it deals with 

- The water in the system is classified as fluid category 4 risk.


---

> Q-102 Which government agency calculate the energy and environmental performance rating and carbon emission of individual dwellings ?


- `SAP`: Standard Assessment Procedure is used to calculate the `energy and environmental performance and carbon emission for individual dwellings`. It is the UK government's procedure for the energy rating of homes.
-  A `DER` and `TER` is calculated. dwellings Emission Rate and Target emission Rate.
-  To comply with building regulations all new homes must have a SAP assessment.
-  SAP uses `SEDBUK` boiler efficiencies to calculate the energy required to meet the heating demand of the building.

---

> Q-103 Which boiler meets the SEDBUK rating ?

- Condensing boilers are the only types that meet the requirement when gas is used and must be installed unless exception is allowed.

---

> Q-104 What is to be checked before installing the combi boiler ? 

- Dwellings must have satisfactory main pressure
- Water supply pipe should be adequate.


---

> Q-105 What are modulating burners ? 

- Most modern combi boilers are designed with modulating burners which reduce the firing rate to match the lower heat output required for space heating.

---

> Q-106 What are combined primary storage unit ? 

- They are special category of storage combi boilers. They include very large store of water ( minimum of 70l) designed to buffer both the hot water and space heating requirements.

---

> Q-107 Which is more efficient system `sealed or vented` ?

- Sealed system is quicker to heat up the dwellings but both are same when it comes to measure `energy efficiency`

---

> Q-108 Why a system called open vented ?

- Open vented refers to the separate vent pipe which is open to the atmospheric pressure.



---

> Q-109 Documents L recommends to use Weather Compensation technology what are they ?

- It offers an energy efficient alternative to traditional timer and thermostat set-up by monitoring outside and inside temperature and adjust the boiler operation.
- The technology works by using changes in the outdoor temperature to decide how warm your radiator need to be.
- With weather compensation technology the boiler will be switched on all the time instead of being controlled by a timer and indoor thermostat. It is rather controlled by sensing the outside temperature.
- By keeping the boiler permanently on for CH the boiler `will not constantly click on and off` avoiding the `boiler cycling`.

---

> Q- 110 Documents L recommends to accommodate the measure of Load compensation what are they ?

- It works by measuring the `heating system response` and `controlling the flow temperature` depending upon the required load.
- When boiler starts to work, the increase in return temperature is measured which indicates how to vary boiler response by controlling the flow temperature. This reduces the fuel consumption.

---

> Q- 111 What is Energy Related product Directive ( ERP ) ? 

- It was launched in 2015 to help cut `European carbon emissions` by eliminating low efficiency heating products.
- In 2018 April Boiler Plus was launched, new boiler installation had to use one of four energy saving features
    + Weather Compensation
    + Load compensation
    + Flue gas heat recovery    
    + Smart controls.

---

> Q-112 What is achieve using OT ( open therm ) protocol ? 

- Using OT a constant temperature of water is maintained in the boiler regardless of both boiler stat and room stat set temperature. Following benefits are achieved
    1. Reduction in wear and tear of the boiler
    2. Lower gas consumption
    3. More comfortable room temperature
    4. Satisfies ERP, 2018 boiler plus regulation given in Part L document.


---

> Q- 113 What are Boiler Plus recommendations ? 

-  Since 2018 April the boiler plus says that:
    +  Gas boiler performance must not be less than ERC 92%
    +  A minimum of a time and temperature control is required for all gas and oil boiler installations
    +  Combi boiler installations must also include one of the following:
        *  Weather compensation
        *  Load compensation
        *  Flue Gas Heat Recovery
        *  Smart control with automation and optimisation.

> Q-114 Time Clocks and programmers

- **Time clock**: They switch on only one circuit suitable for combi boiler.
- **A mini programmer**:  Suitable for C and C-Plan Plus system, allows heating and hot water circuits to be on together.
- **A standard programmer**: Uses same time settings for space heating and hot water.
- **A full Programmer**: Allows both circuits to operate fully independtly and also allow 7 days programming. They are often fitted in front of the boiler but not conveinent if the boiler is fitted at the back.

> Q-116 What TOG rating is considered in under floor heating ? 

- The resistivity provided by the floor board or the carpet is measured in TOG. If it is higher the heat emitted from underfloor will be less.
- With underfloor heating floor covering should have rating of `less than 1` and must never exceed `2.5`

---

Q-117 What is the minimum size of piping for solid fuel gas boilers ? 

- Solid fuel is not easily controllable and natural gas automatically using any regulator or modulating the gas in gas boiler and needs bigger size pipes to allow water expansion. Thus uses `28 mm pipes`. The minimum size is `22 mm`.

---

> Q-117 What material is used in both commercial and residential insulation ?

- `Polystyrene`, It is very rigid, ideal for wall insulation.

--- 
> Q-118 What plastic pressure pipe are used in plumbing industry

- Two grads of PE are used extensively:
    1. MDPE: **Medium density Polyethylene** it is blue in color and conforms to `BS EN 12056-2:2000` standards. It is a hard-wearing plastic for `water pipes, gas pipes and fittings`. It is resistant to shock and has good performance. Since it is susceptible to UV and Sun lights it is recommended that a maximum of `150mm` of pipe is showing when it enters the building.
    2. HDPE: **High density Polyethylene** it was used until 1980s for main cold water pipes but has been supersede by MDPE. It is black in color and comes in grade A, B, C and D.
